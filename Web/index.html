      <h1>Welcome to the flail Home Page</h1>

      <p>
        Flail is a hacker's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mail_client" title="wikipedia: MUA">MUA</a>
        (<em>Mail User Agent</em>, a program you use to read your mail).  It has a terse, extensible,
        Unix-like command-line interface.  It is written in
        <a href="http://www.perl.org" title="Perl: everyone ends up here eventually">Perl</a>, and
        is designed to make Perl hackers happy.  It now comes with a
        Makefile.PL and a README, so what more could you possibly ask?
      </p>

      <p>
        Flail is still mainly programmerware.  If you're a Perl hacker
        and like the idea of using a mailer that lets you map
        arbitrary snippets of Perl code over your messages and folders
        in a terse way, then you might want to check it out.  I
        recently revived the project from the dead, after getting sick
        of my current mailer and deciding my own dogfood
        just <b>had</b> to be better.
      </p>

      <p>
        I use flail to read all my mail, from multiple mailboxes,
        faced with hundreds or even thousands of spams a day,
        using <a href="http://www.gnupg.org" title="The GNU Privacy Guard">GnuPG</a> and
        <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/" title="EMACS: The one, true editor">EMACS</a>
        as my trusty helper apps.  I also highly recommend
        <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/fetchmail/" title="Fetchmail: email protocol swiss army knife / utility belt">fetchmail</a>,
        <a href="http://www.courier-mta.org/maildrop/" title="Maildrop: mail filtering tool">maildrop</a>,
        and <a href="http://bmf.sourceforge.net/" title="bmf: bayesian mail filter">bmf</a>.
        <a href="bits/eg/dot.flailrc">My .flailrc</a> and
        <a href="bits/eg">associated helper modules</a> are
        included, and are probably the best source of examples, along
        with <a href="spam.html" title="Flail-based spam mitigation setup">the page on spam mitigation hacks in flail</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        My original idea for flail was to write a
        <em>variable-weight</em> MUA.  By variable-weight, I mean a
        mailer that you could use from a command-line interface
        (lightweight), a full-blown GUI (heavyweight), or even by
        accessing a detached flail process via HTTP or IRC on the fly
        (sort of medium-weight).  I have used mail systems in the past
        that had this kind of capability, but they are now outdated,
        were always much too large for what they did, and still didn't
        do everything I wanted.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is a modicum of documentation in flail itself, via the
        help command, including a brand-spanking new POD, also
        known as <a href="flail.html" title="the flail manual">the man page</a>.
        To get at all this goodness yourself,
        unpack <a href="bits/flail-0.2.5.tar.gz">the tarball</a>,
        read the <a href="bits/README">README</a>, and follow the instructions.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you like this or want to help me work on it, please let me
        know.  I have a lot of plans for this, but have to work on other
        things now.  Send email to
        <a href="mailto:flail@cluefactory.com">flail@cluefactory.org</a>
        with comments or, better, code.  The <tt>flail-dev@cluefactory.com</tt>
        mailing list also awaits you; send email to
        <tt>flail-dev-subscribe@cluefactory.com</tt> to subscribe.
      </p>

      <p>
        The latest release is <a href="bits/flail-0.2.5.tar.gz">0.2.5</a>.
        You can read <a href="flail.html" title="the flail manual">the manual</a> to get a better idea
        of how flail works.  You might also find some of the CPAN modules
        cached in my <a href="bits/">bits</a> directory of use.
        However, I would suggest trying to satisfy the dependences
        that Makefile.PL complains about using whatever means are
        normal on your system first.  For instance, under
        <a href="http://www.openbsd.org" title="OpenBSD: it's the 'open' stupid!">OpenBSD</a> you would look
        in <tt>/usr/ports</tt> for the missing Perl modules first.
