      <p>
        Flail is a hacker's MUA (<em>Mail User Agent</em>, a program
        you use to read your mail).  It has a terse, extensible,
        Unix-like command-line interface.  It is written in Perl, and
        is designed to make Perl hackers happy.  It now comes with a
        Makefile.PL and a README, so what more could you possibly ask?
      </p>

      <p>
        Flail is still mainly programmerware.  If you're a Perl hacker
        and like the idea of using a mailer that lets you map
        arbitrary snippets of Perl code over your messages and folders
        in a terse way, then you might want to check it out.  I
        recently revived the project from the dead, after getting sick
        of my current mailer and deciding my own dogfood
        just <b>had</b> to be better.
      </p>

      <p>
        I use flail to read all my mail, from multiple
        mailboxes, with GnuPG and EMACS as my trusty helper apps.
        <a href="bits/eg/dot.flailrc">My .flailrc</a> and
        <a href="bits/eg">associated helper modules</a> are
        included, and are probably the best source of examples.
      </p>

      <p>
        My original idea for flail was to write a
        <em>variable-weight</em> MUA.  By variable-weight, I mean a
        mailer that you could use from a command-line interface
        (lightweight), a full-blown GUI (heavyweight), or even by
        accessing a detached flail process via HTTP or IRC on the fly
        (sort of medium-weight).  I have used mail systems in the past
        that had this kind of capability, but they are now outdated,
        were always much too large for what they did, and still didn't
        do everything I wanted.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is a modicum of documentation in flail itself, via the
        help command, including a brand-spanking new POD.
        To get at it, you have to get flail running.
        Unpack <a href="bits/flail-0.2.4.tar.gz">the tarball</a>,
        read the <a href="bits/README">README</a>, and follow the instructions.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you like this or want to help me work on it, please let me
        know.  I have a lot of plans for this, but have to work on other
        things now.  Send email to
        <a href="mailto:flail@cluefactory.com">flail@cluefactory.org</a>
        with comments or, better, code.  The <tt>flail-dev@cluefactory.com</tt>
        mailing list also awaits you; send email to
        <tt>flail-dev-subscribe@cluefactory.com</tt> to subscribe.
      </p>

      <p>
        The latest release is <a href="bits/flail-0.2.4.tar.gz">0.2.4</a>.
        You can read <a href="flail.html">the manual</a> to get a better idea
        of how flail works.  You might also find some of the CPAN modules
        cached in my <a href="bits/">bits</a> directory of use.
        However, I would suggest trying to satisfy the dependences
        that Makefile.PL complains about using whatever means are
        normal on your system first.  For instance, under
        <a href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> you would look
        in <tt>/usr/ports</tt> for the missing Perl modules first.
