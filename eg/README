These are examples that you can check out for inclusion or
adaption into your ~/.flailrc

util.pl - various utility subs that don't go anywhere else
identities.pl - code to manage multiple identities, including a "be" command
autofile.pl - flexible, header- and content-based auto-filing code

The *_config.pl files are separate, sample configurations of the
globals needed by the above modules, e.g. autofile_config.pl goes
with autofile.pl.  You should require them both in your .flailrc,
e.g.


  require 'autofile_config.pl';
  require 'autofile.pl';

This is one of the reasons why the sample .flailrc puts ~/.flail on
@INC if it exists and is a directory - it gives you a place to keep
your flail scripts.
